# 🌟 Key Features

## 🧠 *Introspective Quiz Questions*  
The app begins with a series of carefully crafted quiz questions designed to help users reflect on their emotions, thoughts, and current mental state. These questions are more than just surface-level check-ins—they are thoughtfully designed by mental wellness experts to encourage self-awareness and emotional introspection. By answering them, users not only feel heard but also gain clarity about what they might be experiencing internally.

## 🍵 *Personalized Tea Recommendations*  
Based on the user's emotional input, the app recommends a soothing tea blend tailored to their needs. Herbal teas like chamomile, lavender, lemon balm, or green tea are known to have calming effects on the nervous system. These natural remedies contain compounds that can help reduce cortisol levels, lower heart rate, and improve overall relaxation—offering a simple, yet powerful tool to manage anxiety and stress. It’s like receiving a warm, gentle hug from within.

### 🧘 *Mental Health Exercise Suggestions*  
The app suggests targeted mental health exercises such as guided breathing, mindfulness, journaling prompts, and body scans. These practices are proven to help regulate mood, reduce stress hormones, and enhance emotional resilience. Whether it's a 5-minute grounding technique or a deep-breathing ritual, the exercises are simple yet impactful, and they help users regain a sense of control during overwhelming moments.

### 💌 *Positivity Notes – Your Daily Dose of Emotional Warmth*  
Each user receives a daily positivity note—an emotionally intelligent message crafted to uplift, inspire, and connect. These notes aren't generic affirmations—they're personal, timely, and empathetic. Just like a friend recommending a song or sending a kind message when you need it most, the app creates a human-to-human connection. It bridges the digital gap with compassion and care, making the user feel truly seen and supported.
